# BillSplit frontend app

## Development

First, install your dependencies with:

```shellscript
npm install
```

If you haven't already, copy the `.env.example` file to a new file called `.env`
and fill in the necessary environment variables. The app won't work without
these credentials.

Then, start the server in development mode:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```
